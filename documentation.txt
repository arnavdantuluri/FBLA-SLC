To run the program simply download the code which downloads it in a zip format. 

Once the code is done downloading install the requirments according to the requirments section in the Read.me file.

Once all libraries are installed and project is set up run the login.py script to run the main program.

Sign up as a new user and then login. 

If the google maps api key doesn't work it is either because the key was revoked or I ran out of free credits. If this happens please go to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation and click get started. Once that is done create an account then start a project.

Once the project is started go to this page https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials?project=slc-project-339510 and generate an api key which can replace my api key provided in food.py, recreation.py, tourist.py, and location.py

If you get a message regarding an ip overuse or an error because of that simply restart the program and it should work again. It is caused by a repeated request on the requests library and there is no effective way to solve this when recieveing the data in such abundance as recieved in my program.
